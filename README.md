 This project is developed in python using 
 BDD (Behaviour Driven Development) frame work.

 Gerkin Language which uses simple daily use 
 language and simple keywords like Given , Then
 etc. 
 It make it easy to understand the flow of 
 execution.
 
 We have Automated Smoke test cases in the
 Feature File BPMainFlow which covers features
 of Sign Up , Log In, Download File, Rename 
 file , Share and unshare file , Delete file 
 , Quick Links and log out.
